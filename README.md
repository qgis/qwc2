QGIS Web Client 2 Components
============================

This repository contains the common QWC2 application components from which you can build your own personal QWC2 application.

See:

* [qwc-docker](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-docker) for QWC2 extended with microservices.
* [this presentation](https://blog.sourcepole.ch/assets/2019/qwc2-foss4g19.pdf) for an overview and architecture of QWC2.
